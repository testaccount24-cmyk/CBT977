**   THE TABLE INCLUDED HERE IS FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECTLY FINDING  **
**   A VIDEO THAT YOU WANT TO SEE.  IF FOR SOME REASON, IT ISN'T     **
**   LISTED AT THE ABOVE WEB PAGE, YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO ACCESS IT    **
**   DIRECTLY USING OUR TABLE, ADDRESSING THE URL SPECIFICALLY.      **

**   I NEVER TRUST A WEB PAGE TO STAY THERE FOREVER.  SOMETIMES A    **
**   DIRECT URL WILL PERSIST LONGER THAN THE PAGE POINTING TO IT.    **
**                                                                   **

The following table, member MOSHIXT in this pds, is meant to help
you watch any of the MOSHIX mainframe videos that you want to see.

PLEASE NOTE THAT SOME OF THE RECENT URL'S SEEM TO HAVE GOTTEN
LONGER, SO THAT MORE COLUMNS HAVE TO BE TAKEN UP IN THE MOSHIXT
MEMBER FOR THEM.....!!

Quick Instructions.

Method 1.

Edit or Browse the member MOSHIXT, pick which video you want
to see, use your terminal emulator to copy the URL (the https://
stuff, which is printable EBCDIC) and paste the URL into your
browser, and go.  Since the URL is printable, your cut and paste
mechanism in the terminal emulator should itself make the ASCII
translation.

Method 2.

Download the member MOSHIXT to the PC, WITH ASCII TRANSLATION.

Browse the ASCII member with your browser.

Select the video you want to see.

Copy the URL for that video which is on the same line as the
short description of the video.

Paste the URL into your browser, and go.
